# Flowchart-Detection
Detecting hand drawn flowcharts using Tensorflow Object Detection API


This repository uses Tensorflow Object Detecttion API for detecting hand drawn flowcharts.
The dataset images are located in the folder `models/research/object_detection/images/test`


I have used the Faster-RCNN Inceptionv2 model for detecting the flowcharts.
